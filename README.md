Assignment for Backend developer for senior roles

## Role Based Access Control:

Implement a role based auth system. System should be able to assign a role to user and remove a user from the role.

Entities are USER, ACTION TYPE, RESOURCE, ROLE

ACTION TYPE defines the access level(Ex: READ, WRITE, DELETE)

Access to resources for users are controlled strictly by the role.One user can have multiple roles. Given a user, action type and resource system should be able to tell whether user has access or not.



Please list down the assumptions made. 

***Note:***

1. Use any object oriented programming language.

2. Code should be maintainable and production ready

3. Follow the best practices of engineering and design patterns.

4. A command line application with in memory models will suffice, a REST API or DBs are not required. Our main interest is in code organisation and logic. **Please make sure you use OOP concepts & implementation as much as possible to keep the code clean & extendable.**
